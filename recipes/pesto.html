        <h2>What is Pesto?</h2>
        <p>
            Pesto, or pesto alla genovese, is a basil-based sauce that
            originated in Genoa, the capital of Liguria, Italy. Traditional
            pesto is made with basil leaves, garlic, pine nuts, olive oil, salt,
            and Parmesan (or another type of hard Italian cheese, such as
            Pecorino). You can prepare it with a mortar and pestle (this is the
            traditional method) or using a blender/food processor.
        </p>

        <p>
            Classic pesto alla genovese is made with basil, but the word "pesto"
            refers to anything made by pounding. Other types of Italian pesto
            include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Pesto alla Trapanese</strong>, which is made with basil,
                tomatoes, almonds, garlic, olive oil, and Parmesan.

            <li>
                <strong>Pesto Modenese</strong>, which is made with salami,
                Parmesan, garlic, rosemary or thyme. It's typically found on
                pizza or bread as opposed to pasta.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Pesto Rosso</strong>, which is made with sun-dried
                tomatoes, almonds, red pepper flakes, rosemary, olive oil, and
                garlic.
